# Blog-with-ChatRoom

I have created a web app where you can post blog articles which are saved in a database. You can connect to the web app only if you have the key - which is an image. The image is verified using the PIL library. The interesting part about the webapp is that it has a ChatRoom option where the clients can communicate. This project is not finished yet.
